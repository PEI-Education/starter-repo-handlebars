       "comment": "Hunter is interested in his own learning  some of the time, he listens attentively, and makes a solid effort to avoid distractions that could interrupt the learning process but he doesn't take the initiative to work independently without frequent reminders to continue working. He looks for ways to be helpful in the classroom and he shows a positive attitude with classmates in group projects and activities, and both takes and gives suggestions and directions effectively. Hunter can have a difficult time in certain areas of math but with reminders and support, he quickly learns the outcome.  Reading for 30 minutes each day will continue to help him move forward in his reading fluency and comprehension.  Keep up the good work Hunter.",

She is confident, and actively participates in class discussions. She also enjoys collaborating with her classmates.  Ilsa is reading just below grade level for this term, but she continues to make steady progress in fluency and comprehension. Ilsa is working at, or slightly below, grade level in all subject areas, I feel that she would experience more consistent progress with regular attendance.

I am happy to see that he is more interactive and social but there is a balance that he needs to work on, knowing when to stop chatting and focus on his assignments. In reading we focused on using text features to locate information.  Also, we used various strategies to assist in predicting.  He is using these strategies and is reading at grade level. The first writing trait that we have been working on this term is using a variety of ordering and connecting words and phrases to create some smooth transitions. The second writing trait focused on was having sentences with variations in lengths and beginnings. The third writing trait was consistently using capital letters for proper nouns, at the beginning of a sentence and the pronoun I. This has been an area of struggle for he is not adding enough details in his written work.  I know you can do it Gabriel.",

He is still having a hard time completing classwork in a timely manner, as well as getting his homework done on a regular basis. We will support him in finding ways to keep himself organized and on task during class. This should also be encouraged at home as well. Gabriel is considerate when interacting with his teachers and enjoys sharing personal experiences and opinions with others. Bravo Gabriel!",

The vocabulary still isn\u2019t there, but I am encouraging him to take his time and use the words he knows to describe what he means. When reading, Gabriel uses the information in images and diagrams to help support his comprehension. I will continue working on simple sounds with him this term. Gabriel has missed a significant amount of instructional time since January 4, 2022 during remote learning and I have not been able to accurately assess his progress in writing for this reporting period.",

In Math, he is struggling to keep up with new concepts at times. He could benefit from practicing the multiplication table and he should also continue to practice other basic math skills. Justin should also remember to read for at least 30 minutes each day to continue to improve his fluency and comprehension. Keep up the hard work Justin.",

She has an Academic Learning Plan and is working with adaptations in literacy and math. She attended resource this term to learn new strategies to increase her reading levels and comprehension skills.  Payton is reading below grade level for this time in grade five, but she is making consistent progress in fluency and comprehension. Payton is communicating more frequently  when she needs help and has been more comfortable collaborating with her classmates. I am looking forward to getting to know Payton better!",

The class focused on two Foundational Learnings in literacy during the second term. The first was selecting a fairly well-defined topic with an identifiable or stated main idea or central message. Payton can choose a topic and include a clear message about the topic in her writing some of the time. The second was to explain and support preferences for, and opinions about, a text, authors, and illustrators with some specific details or examples. When thinking about a text, author, or illustrator Payton can sometimes communicate what she likes the most or least and can support his opinion using examples from the text. For our next steps in literacy we will be working on using a wide variety of text features to preview, interpret, and locate information. In writing we will be working on using our experiences and opinions to support a topic with a series of relevant ideas.",

The class focused on the following foundational outcomes in math during the second term. Students worked on their understanding of fractions. Payton has a good understanding of equivalent fractions. She can model and explain that equivalent fractions represent the same quantity. Payton can determine if two given fractions are equivalent using concrete materials or pictorial representations. The second outcome the class worked on was relating decimals to fractions to the thousandths place. Payton can write a given decimal in fractional form. She can write a given fraction with a denominator of 10, 100, or 1000 as a decimal most of the time. She can express a given pictorial or concrete representation as a fraction or a decimal.

       "comment": "Jake has made some progress on the foundational learning outcomes during this reporting period. During the second term, students used a wide variety of text features (headings, subheadings, index, sidebars, charts, diagrams, maps, font) to preview information while working on their Canada slideshows and examining non-fiction texts.  They also included a series of relevant events, usually based on relevant personal experiences, supported opinions or accurate information in their writing. Jake has done a much better job adding details to his writing this term, it is important that he continue to work on that in order to push his writing to grade level.  Keep up the good work Jake.",

Although he struggles with some of the Numeracy concepts, he doesn\u2019t give up when trying to complete the work. He tackles new challenges with eagerness and a positive outlook. Jake is a kind and thoughtful friend to many in the class but he needs some reminders to be attentive during instructions and lessons.  He can be easily distracted when it is time to do independent work as a follow up to the current lesson and this is causing him to struggle with some concepts that are being taught.   Jake is encouraged to use time wisely to finish tasks in the time required. He should continue to make sure he is reading 30 minutes each day in order to continue to progress with his fluency and comprehension.  He has many great ideas to share in his writing, but he continues to struggle to get these ideas onto the page.  He is able to use a variety of resources to assist with this skill.  We will continue to work on this into the last term.",

Practicing basic multiplication and division facts would benefit her.  Shilow sometimes works hard in math class independently and rarely participates in math activities with partners or the whole group.

The first writing trait we have been working on is selecting a fairly well-defined topic with an identifiable or stated main idea\/central message. Also, including relevant ideas\/events, usually based on personal experiences, supported opinions or accurate information. She has good ideas but tends to rush and not complete her thoughts.  In reading we focused on using text features to locate information.  Also, we used various strategies to assist in predicting. The third strategy was being able to explain their preferences in authors, and illustrators. She shows a great love of reading and is at grade level.  Good work Shilow!",

This term in French Language Arts we have worked on procedural writing and opinion writing. Hudson has demonstrated a good understanding of these topics. Hudson is usually able to use the infinitive tense to give directions in simple sentences during a procedural piece of writing. Hudson worked hard to translate a recipe from English to French and gave a wonderful presentation of said recipe. Hudson has also developed skills in opinion writing and has been able to share their opinion on various topics. Hudson works hard during writing class and usually shares thoughtful and precise ideas. Hudson is usually able to communicate with both teachers and peers in French. Hudson is a great self advocate and always asks for help when needed. I would encourage Hudson to work on endurance when it comes to writing so as to be able to work independently for longer periods of time.",

Hudson has shown a good understanding of topics covered including adding and subtracting decimal numbers, converting improper fractions to mixed numbers, multi digit multiplication and long division.  Hudson has done very well with multi digit multiplication and can successfully use strategies learned in class to solve two digit by two digit problems. Hudson has even attempted some harder problems including 3 or 4 digit numbers. He has grasped the basics of long division, he can usually solve problems on his own but sometimes asks for reassurance that he is on the right track. Regular practice of multiplication and division facts is always encouraged!!  Hudson works very hard in math class and enjoys participating in all math activities. I would like to see Hudson continue to explore his math abilities!",

The first writing trait we have been working on is selecting a fairly well-defined topic with an identifiable or stated main idea\/central message. Also, including relevant ideas\/events, usually based on personal experiences, supported opinions or accurate information. She uses all the lessons to make her work better. In reading we focused on using text features to locate information.  Also, we used various strategies to assist in predicting. The third strategy was being able to explain their preferences in authors, and illustrators. She uses all her strategies and is reading at grade level.  Keep up the hard work Gwen!",

In Writing, Coulson has been working on using strategies to write unknown words and staying on topic when drafting a piece of writing.  He continues to work on staying on topic when developing ideas and does best when working with a graphic organizer.  In Reading, Coulson has been working on using multiple strategies to solve simple words and self-correcting when his reading does not make sense.  He continues to work on monitoring when self-correcting is needed and  making appropriate changes more consistently.

The second was to explain and support preferences for, and opinions about, a text, authors, and illustrators with some specific details or examples. When thinking about a text, author, or illustrator Scarlett can communicate what she likes the most or least and can support her opinion using examples from the text.

Scarlett has a good understanding of equivalent fractions. She can model and explain that equivalent fractions represent the same quantity. Scarlett can determine if two given fractions are equivalent using concrete materials or pictorial representations. The second outcome the class worked on was relating decimals to fractions to the thousandths place. Scarlett can write a given decimal in fractional form. She can write a given fraction with a denominator of 10, 100, or 1000 as a decimal most of the time. She can express a given pictorial or concrete representation as a fraction or a decimal.

       "comment": "I have enjoyed getting to know Brennon these past three weeks. Brennan is an enthusiastic and friendly member of our class. He is a great communicator and is able to effectively express what he needs to learn successfully. Brennan has an Academic Learning Plan and is working with adaptations in literacy. Brennan has made great progress in reading and is currently exactly where he should be for this term in grade five. He continues to progress in both fluency and comprehension. I am looking forward to getting to know Brennan better!",

       "comment": "Brennan has made steady progress on the foundational learning outcomes in Language Arts during this reporting period. The class focused on two Foundational Learnings in literacy during the second term. The first was selecting a fairly well-defined topic with an identifiable or stated main idea or central message. Brennan can consistently choose a topic and include a clear message about the topic in his writing. The second was to explain and support preferences for, and opinions about, a text, authors, and illustrators with some specific details or examples. When thinking about a text, author, or illustrator Brennan can communicate what he likes the most or least and can support his opinion using examples from the text. For our next steps in literacy we will be working on using a wide variety of text features to preview, interpret, and locate information. In writing we will be working on using our experiences and opinions to support a topic with a series of relevant ideas.",

The class focused on the following foundational outcomes in math during the second term. Students worked on their understanding of fractions. Brennan can create a set of equivalent fractions and explain why there are many equivalent fractions. He can model and explain that equivalent fractions represent the same quantify. Brennan can determine if two given fractions are equivalent using concrete materials or pictorial representations. The second outcome the class worked on was relating decimals to fractions to the thousandths place. Brennan can write a given decimal in fractional form. He can write a given fraction with a denominator of 10, 100, or 1000 as a decimal. He can express a given pictorial or concrete representation as a fraction or a decimal. The class is currently working on using estimation strategies including front end rounding, compensation and compatible numbers.",

Although Kaeo is a quiet student, she is thoughtful, insightful and thorough in written and verbal communication, and has a talent for expressing her ideas clearly.  Kaeo showed a positive attitude with classmates in group projects and activities, and both takes and gives suggestions and directions effectively.  She had a good understanding of most of the math concepts taught so far this year but as a result of not having seen any of her work since December, it is very difficult to know if she can complete the outcomes at this time.  Kaeo was conscious of putting care into her daily writing work, and would frequently go beyond the minimum requirements for assignments.  Kaeo was a pleasure to work with each day and I look forward to seeing her back in the class.",

He is always willing to help fellow classmates and he has a great attitude! Hudson is currently reading at grade level and he continues to make steady progress in fluency and comprehension. Hudson is working at grade level in all subject areas, however, I feel that he would experience more consistent progress with regular attendance. I am looking forward to getting to know Hudson better!",

When reading, Jaxen uses the information in images and diagrams to help support his comprehension. I will continue working on simple sounds with him this term.

Jaxen has shown a developing understanding of topics covered including adding and subtracting decimal numbers, converting improper fractions to mixed numbers, multi digit multiplication and long division.  Jaxen is able to solve some multi digit multiplication questions with support. Jaxen has shown a minimal understanding of long division. Practicing basic multiplication and division facts would benefit him.  Jaxen sometimes works hard in math class independently and occasionally participates in math activities with partners or the whole group. I would encourage Jaxen to ask for help when needed and be practicing these skills at home. I am happy to offer extra help at recess when needed, and would encourage Jaxen to attend if he feels he needs a review.",

The first writing trait we have been working on is selecting a fairly well-defined topic with an identifiable or stated main idea\/central message. Also, including relevant ideas\/events, usually based on personal experiences, supported opinions or accurate information. He has the ideas but tends to not believe he can do it.  He chooses wisely where he sits so that he can touch base with me and this helps in stay on track. I am pleased with what he is producing but there is room for growth. In reading we focused on using text features to locate information.  Also, we used various strategies to assist in predicting. The third strategy was being able to explain their preferences in authors, and illustrators. He is using all his strategies and is progressing in reading too.  He is working at grade level.  Keep up the good work Nolan!",

Nolan is thoughtful and kind to others, he will always help a classmate in need. Nolan sometimes struggles with staying on task and can often become sidetracked and need redirection from a teacher. He is capable of producing quality work however he will often not use his time wisely and end up submitting rushed or unfinished work. Nolan is a bright student and would benefit from slowing down, taking his time and finding a quiet place to concentrate on his tasks. He has been enjoying flexible seating options such as the Hokki stools and lap desks. These tools allow Nolan to sit where he is comfortable and help him accomplish his tasks.

Kherington has enjoyed identifying symbols and creating suggestions for new ones. Kherington  has created a stamp to represent Canada. In addition to identifying Canadian symbols, we have been discussing symbols found at the Olympics including designing a new outfit for Canadian athletes. Kherington is able to explain why something is chosen as a symbol for our country. Going forward, we will continue to explore Canadian culture and identity through various means!",

       "comment": "Term 2 has been one of ups and downs for Emma-Jane. I am struggling with getting her complete attention and because of this she is missing directions and ends up getting frustrated with me and herself. In reading we focused on using text features to locate information.  Also, we used various strategies to assist in predicting. The third strategy was being able to explain their preferences in authors, and illustrators. Emma-Jane is doing well in reading and comprehending. The first writing trait we have been working on is selecting a fairly well-defined topic with an identifiable or stated main idea\/central message. Also, including relevant ideas\/events, usually based on personal experiences, supported opinions or accurate information. In writing she tends to rush to get her work done.  She sees suggestions on ways to improve her work as a negative not as me teaching to help her.  I hope that the third term will be the best one yet.  I believe in you Emma-Jane.",

We will support her in finding ways to keep herself organized and on task during class. This should also be encouraged at home as well.

When reading, Emma-Jane can explain the cause of emotions felt by the characters. I will continue working on simple sounds with her this term.

The second was to explain and support preferences for, and opinions about, a text, authors, and illustrators with some specific details or examples. When thinking about a text, author, or illustrator Avery can communicate what she likes the most or least and can support her opinion using examples from the text. For our next steps in literacy we will be working on using a wide variety of text features to preview, interpret, and locate information.

She can model and explain that equivalent fractions represent the same quantity. Avery can determine if two given fractions are equivalent using concrete materials or pictorial representations. The second outcome the class worked on was relating decimals to fractions to the thousandths place. Avery can write a given decimal in fractional form. She can write a given fraction with a denominator of 10, 100, or 1000 as a decimal most of the time. She can express a given pictorial or concrete representation as a fraction or a decimal.

I would like to see Callan's confidence in himself strengthen.  I believe he can accomplish amazing things! I am looking forward to getting to know Callan better!",

       "comment": "Callan has made steady progress on the foundational learning outcomes in Language Arts during this reporting period. The class focused on two Foundational Learnings in literacy during the second term. The first was selecting a fairly well-defined topic with an identifiable or stated main idea or central message. Callan can choose a topic and include a clear message about the topic in her writing most of the time. The second was to explain and support preferences for, and opinions about, a text, authors, and illustrators with some specific details or examples. When thinking about a text, author, or illustrator Callan can communicate what he likes the most or least and can support his opinion using examples from the text. For our next steps in literacy we will be working on using a wide variety of text features to preview, interpret, and locate information. In writing we will be working on using our experiences and opinions to support a topic with a series of relevant ideas.",

Caden is well prepared for class each day and completes assignments on time. He tackles classroom assignments, tasks, and group work in an organized manner. When working independently, Caden is able to stay on task with little supervision. Bravo Caden!",

He consistently speaks French with his teachers and peers. When reading, Caden uses the information in images, graphs, diagrams, and page organization to help support his comprehension. I will continue working on silent letters at the end of words with him. Caden feels comfortable using paragraphs in his information texts. He is confident with online research for his texts. As a next step, I encourage him to add more details to his sentences and paragraphs, as well as be more consistent with plural endings.",

As we pivoted back Caden seems to have a loss interest and I am hoping that this will improve. In reading we focused on using text features to locate information.  Also, we used various strategies to assist in predicting. The third strategy was being able to explain their preferences in authors, and illustrators. I was unable to read with him due to his absences. The first writing trait we have been working on is selecting a well-defined topic with an identifiable or stated main idea.  Also, including relevant ideas\/events, usually based on personal experiences. He needs to add more details and follow the format of the piece assigned.  I know you can do it Caden!",

Jack is a great participator in group discussions and enjoys collaborating with his classmates. Jack is reading at grade level for this term, and continues to progress in fluency and comprehension. I would like to see Jack focus on his work independently with fewer reminders to stay on task. I am looking forward to getting to know Jack better!",

The class focused on two Foundational Learnings in literacy during the second term. The first was selecting a fairly well-defined topic with an identifiable or stated main idea or central message. Jack can consistently choose a topic and include a clear message about the topic in his writing. The second was to explain and support preferences for, and opinions about, a text, authors, and illustrators with some specific details or examples. When thinking about a text, author, or illustrator Jack can communicate what he likes the most or least and can support his opinion using examples from the text. For our next steps in literacy we will be working on using a wide variety of text features to preview, interpret, and locate information.

I really hope that we can meet during parent-teacher interviews to discuss this. In reading we focused on using text features to locate information. Also, we used various strategies to assist in predicting.  Zander is not reading at grade level and the more he can read independently the more likely his skills will improve. The first writing trait we have been working on is selecting a fairly well-defined topic with an identifiable or stated main idea\/central message.  Also, including relevant ideas\/events, usually based on personal experiences, supported opinions or accurate information. It has been a struggle to motivate Zander to produce during writing class.  I am hoping that after we meet that you will be able to help me reach Zander in the third term.  I want to help you succeed, Zander.",

When reading, Zander uses the information in images and diagrams to help support his comprehension. I will continue working on simple sounds with him this term.

       "comment": "Kaitlynn has made some progress on the mathematics foundational learnings during this reporting period. The class focused on the following foundational outcomes in math during the second term. Students worked on their understanding of fractions. Kaitlynn has a good understanding of equivalent fractions. She can model and explain that equivalent fractions represent the same quantity. Kaitlynn can determine if two given fractions are equivalent using concrete materials or pictorial representations. The second outcome the class worked on was relating decimals to fractions to the thousandths place. Kaitlynn can write a given decimal in fractional form. She can write a given fraction with a denominator of 10, 100, or 1000 as a decimal most of the time. She can express a given pictorial or concrete representation as a fraction or a decimal. The class is currently working on using estimation strategies including front end rounding, compensation and compatible numbers.",

Kaitlynn is working with adaptations in Literacy and Math to help her achieve grade level outcomes with success. She attended resource this term to learn new strategies to increase her reading levels and comprehension skills. Kaitlynn is reading below grade level at this time in grade five, but she continues to make progress in both fluency and comprehension. I am looking forward to getting to know Kaitlynn better!",

The second was to explain and support preferences for, and opinions about, a text, authors, and illustrators with some specific details or examples. When thinking about a text, author, or illustrator Haley can communicate what she likes the most or least and can support her opinion using examples from the text.

       "comment": "Millar has had some success in term 2. I did not see very much participation during home learning but now that we are back she is working hard and improving daily. In reading we focused on using text features to locate information.  Also, we used various strategies to assist in predicting. The third strategy was being able to explain their preferences in authors, and illustrators. She is using the strategies and is reading at grade level. The first writing trait we have been working on is selecting a fairly well-defined topic with an identifiable or stated main idea\/central message. Also, including relevant ideas\/events, usually based on personal experiences, supported opinions or accurate information. She has the ideas but needs to add more details to her work.

We continue to work with her to become more confident in sharing with the whole class, as her opinions are always welcome. Millar does not hesitate to ask for clarification when needed. She works independently with minimal guidance and continues to work hard to meet timelines whether in class or for homework. Bravo Millar!",

The vocabulary still isn\u2019t there, but I am encouraging her to take her time and use the words she knows to describe what she means. When reading, Millar uses the information in images and diagrams to help support her comprehension. I will continue working on silent letters at the end of words with her this term. Millar feels comfortable researching information online for her written texts. She has good introductions, and adds capitals and punctuation. As a next step, I encourage her to divide her information into paragraphs and to add more details to her sentences.",

Millar has shown a developing understanding of topics covered including adding and subtracting decimal numbers, converting improper fractions to mixed numbers, multi digit multiplication and long division.  Millar is able to solve most multi digit multiplication questions with support. Millar has shown a minimal understanding of long division. Practicing basic multiplication and division facts would benefit her.  Millar usually works hard in math class independently and rarely participates in math activities with partners or the whole group. I would encourage Millar to ask for help when needed and be practicing these skills at home. I am happy to offer extra help at recess when needed, and would encourage Millar to attend if she feels she needs a review.",

This term in French Language Arts we have worked on procedural writing and opinion writing. Elianna has demonstrated an excellent understanding of these topics. Elianna is able to use the infinitive tense to give directions in simple sentences during a procedural piece of writing. Elianna worked hard to translate a recipe from English to French and gave a wonderful presentation of said recipe. Elianna has also developed skills in opinion writing and has been able to share their opinion on various topics. Elianna works hard during writing class and always shares thoughtful and precise ideas. Elianna is able to communicate with both teachers and peers in French with ease.

He usually works very hard in math class and enjoys participating in all math activities. I would like to see Ryan continue to explore his math abilities!",

This term in French Language Arts we have worked on procedural writing and opinion writing. Briella has demonstrated an excellent understanding of these topics.

Briella worked hard to translate a recipe from English to French and gave a wonderful presentation of said recipe.

Dylan is well prepared for class each day and completes assignments on time. He tackles classroom assignments, tasks, and group work in an organized manner.

He speaks in complete sentences and tries to use the vocabulary we are working on in class. When reading, Dylan uses the information in images, graphs, diagrams, and page organization to help support his comprehension. I will continue working on silent letters at the end of words with him this term. Dylan feels comfortable using paragraphs in his information texts. He uses a variety of sentences to help develop a subject. As a next step, I encourage him to add more details to his sentences and paragraphs, as well as ensuring he knows if the word is masculine or feminine.",

The class focused on two Foundational Learnings in literacy during the second term. The first was selecting a fairly well-defined topic with an identifiable or stated main idea or central message. Hudson can consistently choose a topic and include a clear message about the topic in his writing. The second was to explain and support preferences for, and opinions about, a text, authors, and illustrators with some specific details or examples. When thinking about a text, author, or illustrator Hudson can communicate what he likes the most or least and can support his opinion using examples from the text. For our next steps in literacy we will be working on using a wide variety of text features to preview, interpret, and locate information. In writing we will be working on using our experiences and opinions to support a topic with a series of relevant ideas.",

       "comment": "Hudson has made steady progress on the mathematics foundational learning outcomes during this reporting period. The class focused on the following foundational outcomes in math during the second term. Students worked on their understanding of fractions. Hudson can create a set of equivalent fractions and explain why there are many equivalent fractions. He can model and explain that equivalent fractions represent the same quantify. Hudson can determine if two given fractions are equivalent using concrete materials or pictorial representations. The second outcome the class worked on was relating decimals to fractions to the thousandths place. Hudson can write a given decimal in fractional form. He can write a given fraction with a denominator of 10, 100, or 1000 as a decimal. He can express a given pictorial or concrete representation as a fraction or a decimal. The class is currently working on using estimation strategies including front end rounding, compensation and compatible numbers.",

Zoey is mannerly and has a great sense of humor and quick wit when sharing thoughts and ideas during discussions. She is helpful to other students  and she demonstrates great potential to be a leader within the group.  She continues to read at Grade level and she has a wonderful voice within her writing but she needs to continue to work on the organization and expansion of her ideas.  Zoey has worked very hard to learn the new math concepts this term and although she can struggle at times, she is very good to continue to work at more challenging outcomes, becoming more comfortable with her basic math facts would help her greatly.

The class focused on the following foundational outcomes in math during the second term. Students worked on their understanding of fractions. Lilyanne can create a set of equivalent fractions and explain why there are many equivalent fractions. She can model and explain that equivalent fractions represent the same quantify. Lilyanne can determine if two given fractions are equivalent using concrete materials or pictorial representations. The second outcome the class worked on was relating decimals to fractions to the thousandths place. Lilyanne can write a given decimal in fractional form. She can write a given fraction with a denominator of 10, 100, or 1000 as a decimal. She can express a given pictorial or concrete representation as a fraction or a decimal. The class is currently working on using estimation strategies including front end rounding, compensation and compatible numbers.",

He has been working on double digit addition and subtraction without regrouping, and is able to now do this independently.  He will continue to work on regrouping when adding and subtracting two digit numbers. Jaxen has also been working on recognizing coins and exchanging money.  He will continue to work on recognizing names of coins and their value.  At home, Jaxen is encouraged to practice recognizing the value of coins and telling time in real life situations.",

In whole group and small group settings, our class has been working on when to speak and when to listen as well as contributing thoughts and ideas. Jaxen is able to actively listen and is encouraged to ask questions if directions are unclear.  In Writing, Jaxen has been working on using strategies to write unknown words and staying on topic when writing.  He has improved in this ability with each writing piece  In Reading, Jaxen has been working on using multiple strategies to solve simple words and self-correcting when his reading does not make sense. Jaxen continues to work on monitoring when self-correcting is needed in higher level books than last term. At home, Jaxen can continue to listen to a book read aloud for at least 20 minutes nightly and talk about the key details of what he has read.",

Although she continues to need frequent reminders to be attentive and to stay on task during instructions and lessons, she is very good to follow the prompts and will continue to complete the task at hand.  Madi will at times need encouragement in math as she continues to struggle with basic math concepts but with extra time and attention, she is able and willing to complete her work.  Madi is very social and enjoys group work with her classmates. She also enjoys sharing her thoughts and ideas verbally, she needs to continue to work on expanding her ideas within her pieces of writing.  Madi should continue to read at least 30 minutes a day to continue to progress her fluency and comprehension. Keep up the great work Madi!!",

       "comment": "Jacob has made steady progress on the foundational learning outcomes during this reporting period. The class focused on two Foundational Learnings in literacy during the second term. The first was selecting a fairly well-defined topic with an identifiable or stated main idea or central message. Jacob can choose a topic and include a clear message about the topic in his writing. The second was to explain and support preferences for, and opinions about, a text, authors, and illustrators with some specific details or examples. When thinking about a text, author, or illustrator Jacob can communicate what he likes the most or least and can support his opinion using examples from the text.

Jacob can determine if two given fractions are equivalent using concrete materials or pictorial representations. The second outcome the class worked on was relating decimals to fractions to the thousandths place. Jacob can write a given decimal in fractional form. He can write a given fraction with a denominator of 10, 100, or 1000 as a decimal. He can express a given pictorial or concrete representation as a fraction or a decimal.

       "comment": "Lylah has made steady progress on the foundational learning outcomes in Language Arts during this reporting period. The class focused on two Foundational Learnings in literacy during the second term. The first was selecting a fairly well-defined topic with an identifiable or stated main idea or central message. Lylah can consistently choose a topic and include a clear message about the topic in her writing. The second was to explain and support preferences for, and opinions about, a text, authors, and illustrators with some specific details or examples. When thinking about a text, author, or illustrator Lylah can communicate what she likes the most or least and can support her opinion using examples from the text.

Mackenzie is developing the ability to listen and watch others to know when she should join in. In Writing, Mackenzie has been working on using strategies to write unknown words and staying on topic when drafting a piece of writing. She utilizes the Voice to Text function well and continues to work on staying on topic when developing ideas.  In Reading, Mackenzie has been listening to books read aloud to her and is able to verbally discuss what she has listened to.

The class focused on the following foundational outcomes in math during the second term. Students worked on their understanding of fractions. Elina can create a set of equivalent fractions and explain why there are many equivalent fractions. She can model and explain that equivalent fractions represent the same quantity. She can determine if two given fractions are equivalent using concrete materials or pictorial representations. The second outcome the class worked on was relating decimals to fractions to the thousandths place. Elina can write a given decimal in fractional form and write a given fraction with a denominator of 10, 100, or 1000 as a decimal. Elina can also express a given pictorial or concrete representation as a fraction or a decimal. The class is currently working on using estimation strategies including front end rounding, compensation and compatible numbers.",

Gabby has shown a developing understanding of topics covered including adding and subtracting decimal numbers, converting improper fractions to mixed numbers, multi digit multiplication and long division.  Gabby is able to solve most multi digit multiplication questions with support. Gabby has shown a minimal understanding of long division. Practicing basic multiplication and division facts would benefit her.  Gabby usually works hard in math class independently and participates in math activities with partners or the whole group. I would encourage Gabby to ask for help when needed and be practicing these skills at home. I am happy to offer extra help at recess when needed, and would encourage Gabby to attend if she feels she needs a review.",

In reading we focused on using text features to locate information.  Also, we used various strategies to assist in predicting. The third strategy was being able to explain their preferences in authors, and illustrators. She is reading and comprehending at grade level. The first writing trait we have been working on is selecting a fairly well-defined topic with an identifiable or stated main idea\/central message.  Also, including relevant ideas\/events, usually based on personal experiences, supported opinions or accurate information. She uses the lessons in her writing pieces to make them the best they can be.  Keep up the hard work Gabby!",

       "comment": "Gabby has made significant progress on the foundational learning outcomes during this reporting period. I am so impressed by how hard Gabby has worked this term! She has improved in all areas of French Language Arts. Gabby is more confident in speaking in front of the class as she has added many words to her vocabulary. She is an active listener as well. When reading, Gabby uses the information in images, graphs, diagrams, and page organization to help support her comprehension. I will continue working on simple sounds with her this term. Gabby feels comfortable using paragraphs in her information texts. She uses a variety of sentences to help develop a subject. As a next step, I encourage her to add more details to her sentences and paragraphs.",

The class focused on the following foundational outcomes in math during the second term. Students worked on their understanding of fractions. Landon is developing an understanding of equivalent fractions. He is making progress towards modeling and explaining that equivalent fractions represent the same quantity. The second outcome the class worked on was relating decimals to fractions to the thousandths place. Landon is working hard to represent a given decimal in fractional form and to express a given pictorial or concrete representation as a fraction or a decimal. The class is currently working on using estimation strategies including front end rounding, compensation and compatible numbers.",

She is always very responsible in asking for help if needed and she takes directions and instructions very well.

       "comment": "Cielo has made some progress on the mathematics foundational learnings during this reporting period. The class focused on the following foundational outcomes in math during the second term. Students worked on their understanding of fractions. Cielo has a good understanding of equivalent fractions. She can model and explain that equivalent fractions represent the same quantity. Cielo can determine if two given fractions are equivalent using concrete materials or pictorial representations. The second outcome the class worked on was relating decimals to fractions to the thousandths place. Cielo can write a given decimal in fractional form. She can write a given fraction with a denominator of 10, 100, or 1000 as a decimal most of the time. She can express a given pictorial or concrete representation as a fraction or a decimal. The class is currently working on using estimation strategies including front end rounding, compensation and compatible numbers.",
