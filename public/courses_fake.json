Auditory, visual and tactile learning activities were key in helping students experience success. Connecting real-life scenarios to French language instruction was also important. Merci sincèrement Tia pour tes efforts en français. Wishing you a healthy and happy summer vacation. Madame Thain et merci à  Mademoiselle Parker.",
