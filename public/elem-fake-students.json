In reading, Samantha can consistently monitor her reading, and has the ability to recognize her mistakes when meaning is lost.  Samantha uses strategies to identify the problem, and will go back and make changes to her reading if necessary. \nIn writing, Samantha will most times use proper punctuation at the end of sentences, but still requires some occasional reminders.  Samantha continues to work on generating ideas for her writing, and is still practicing the importance of developing details to support those ideas in an effort to make her writing more interesting to the reader.  We will be continuing to work on these outcomes going forward, as well as building on them as the year goes on.\nSamantha has made some progress on the foundational learning outcomes during this reporting period.",

Samantha can be very quiet and isn\u2019t always eager to share or volunteer during class discussions but will do so when called upon. Samantha seems to enjoy her time at school and we really love having her as part of our Grade 3A class.  We would encourage Samantha to keep working hard and to try and make reading and math practice a priority at home. Way to go, Samantha!",

Tanner continues learning how to use the reading strategies effectively.  It is very important to continue reading at home and to explore different genres in order to continue improving his reading skills.\nThis term we have focussed on generating ideas in our Writer\u2019s Notebook, recount and narrative writing.   Tanner presents most ideas\/events in an appropriate order, uses some connecting words and spells many high-frequency words correctly.  Tanner has made progress in including details but needs takes more risks in his writing. Next term we will continue working on adding more details and description.",

Sean continues monitoring his reading and self-correct when meaning is lost, sometimes he can identify problems and employ \u201Cfix-up\u201D strategies. It is very important to continue reading at home and to explore different genres in order to continue improving his reading skills. This term we have focussed on generating ideas in our Writer\u2019s Notebook, recount and narrative writing.  Sean presents most ideas\/events in an appropriate order, uses some connecting words and spells many high-frequency words correctly. Sean has made progress in including details but needs takes more risks in his writing, also, he will continue working on his EAL goals to improve his English. Next term we will continue working on adding more details and description.",

Seth continues monitoring his reading and self-correct when meaning is lost, sometimes he can identify problems and employ \u201Cfix-up\u201D strategies. It is very important to continue reading at home and to explore different genres in order to continue improving his reading skills.\nThis term we have focussed on generating ideas in our Writer\u2019s Notebook, recount and narrative writing.   Seth presents ideas\/events in basic sequence,links ideas with simple connecting words and many high-frequency words are not spelled correctly. Seth has made some progress this term and will continue working on his EAL goals to improve his English. Next term we will continue working on adding more details and description.",

This term we focused on identifying key elements of narrative texts. Ainsleigh  can monitor her reading and self-correct when reading does not  make sense. She can respond accurately to most literal questions by locating specific details but she tends to rely on information located in one place.  It is very important to continue reading at home and to explore different genres in order to continue improving her reading skills.  This term we have focussed on generating ideas in our Writer\u2019s Notebook, recount and narrative writing.  Ainsleigh presents ideas\/events in basic sequence,links ideas with simple connecting words and many high-frequency words are not spelled correctly. Ainsleigh has made some progress this term and will continue working on her ALP goals to improve her writing. Next term we will continue working on adding more details and description.",

Cameron continues using the reading strategies effectively. It is very important to continue reading at home and to explore different genres in order to continue improving his reading skills. This term we have focussed on generating ideas in our Writer\u2019s Notebook, recount and narrative writing. Cameron presents most ideas\/events in an appropriate order, uses some connecting words and spells many high-frequency words correctly.  Cameron has made progress in including details but needs takes more risks in his writing. Next term we will continue working on adding more details and description.",

Gavin  can monitor his reading and self-correct when reading does not  make sense. He can respond accurately to most literal questions by locating specific details but he tends to rely on information located in one place.  It is very important to continue reading at home and to explore different genres in order to continue improving his reading skills.  This term we have focussed on generating ideas in our Writer\u2019s Notebook, recount and narrative writing. Gavin presents most ideas\/events in an appropriate order, uses some connecting words and spells but high-frequency words are not spelled correctly. Gavin has made progress in including details but needs takes more risks in his writing. Next term we will continue working on adding more details and description.",

Cameron continues using the reading strategies effectively. It is very important to continue reading at home and to explore different genres in order to continue improving his reading skills.  This term we have focussed on generating ideas in our Writer\u2019s Notebook, recount and narrative writing.   Cameron presents most ideas\/events in an appropriate order, uses some connecting words and spells many high-frequency words correctly.  Cameron has made progress in including details but needs takes more risks in his writing. Next term we will continue working on adding more details and description.",

This term we have focussed on generating ideas in our Writer\u2019s Notebook, recount and narrative writing.

Bryce continues using the reading strategies effectively.  It is very important to continue reading at home and to explore different genres in order to continue improving his reading skills\nThis term we have focussed on generating ideas in our Writer\u2019s Notebook, recount and narrative writing.   Bryce presents most ideas\/events in an appropriate order, uses some connecting words but  many high-frequency words are not spelled correctly. Bryce has made some progress in including details but needs takes more risks in his writing. Next term we will continue working on adding more details and description.",

Delaney  can monitor her reading and self-correct when reading does not  make sense. She can respond accurately to most literal questions by locating specific details but she tends to rely on information located in one place.  It is very important to continue reading at home and to explore different genres in order to continue improving her reading skills. This term we have focussed on generating ideas in our Writer\u2019s Notebook, recount and narrative writing.  Delaney presents ideas\/events in basic sequence,links ideas with simple connecting words and many high-frequency words are not spelled correctly. Delaney has made some progress this term and will continue working on her ALP goals to improve her writing and reading.. Next term we will continue working on adding more details and description.",

This term we focused on identifying key elements of narrative texts. Gene continues monitoring his reading and self-correct when meaning is lost, sometimes he can identify problems and employ \u201Cfix-up\u201D strategies. It is very important to continue reading at home and to explore different genres in order to continue improving his reading skills. This term we have focussed on generating ideas in our Writer\u2019s Notebook, recount and narrative writing.   Gene presents ideas\/events in basic sequence,links ideas with simple connecting words and many high-frequency words are not spelled correctly. Gene has made some progress this term and will continue working on his ALP goals to improve his writing. Next term we will continue working on adding more details and description.",

Meekah continues using the reading strategies effectively. It is very important to continue reading at home and to explore different genres in order to continue improving his reading skills.  This term we have focussed on generating ideas in our Writer\u2019s Notebook, recount and narrative writing.   Meekah presents most ideas\/events in an appropriate order, uses some connecting words and spells many high-frequency words correctly.  Meekah has made progress in including details but needs takes more risks in his writing. Next term we will continue working on adding more details and description.",

This term we have focussed on generating ideas in our Writer\u2019s Notebook, recount and narrative writing.  Dustin presents ideas\/events in basic sequence,links ideas with simple connecting words and many high-frequency words are not spelled correctly. Dustin has made some progress this term and will continue working on his ALP goals to improve his writing. Next term we will continue working on adding more details and description.",

Willow continues learning how to use the reading strategies effectively.  It is very important to continue reading at home and to explore different genres in order to continue improving her reading skills. This term we have focussed on generating ideas in our Writer\u2019s Notebook, recount and narrative writing.   Willow presents most ideas\/events in an appropriate order, uses some connecting words but many high-frequency words are not spelled correctly. Willow has made progress in including details but needs takes more risks in her writing. Next term we will continue working on adding more details and description.",

Alex continues using the reading strategies effectively. It is very important to continue reading at home and to explore different genres in order to continue improving his reading skills. This term we have focussed on generating ideas in our Writer\u2019s Notebook, recount and narrative writing. Alexander presents most ideas\/events in an appropriate order, uses some connecting words and spells many high-frequency words correctly. Alexander has made progress in including details but needs takes more risks in his writing. Next term we will continue working on adding more details and description.",

Jayda continues learning how to use the reading strategies effectively.  It is very important to continue reading at home and to explore different genres in order to continue improving her reading skills.  This term we have focussed on generating ideas in our Writer\u2019s Notebook, recount and narrative writing.  Jayda presents most ideas\/events in an appropriate order, uses some connecting words and spells many high-frequency words  re not spelled correctly. Jayda has made progress in including details but needs takes more risks in her writing. Next term we will continue working on adding more details and description.",

They are: the consistent use of capital letters for proper nouns, the first of a sentence and the pronoun I, also variation of sentence length and use of effective transition words. She is doing well with her use of capitals and periods but is not consistently completing her assignments.  Adding more details and following directions will make a big difference in her work.  There are times she seems to find it hard to concentrate and we will work on that together.   In reading the two outcomes worked on are: using all sources of information to solve unknown words and identifying most key story elements and including some relevant details. She is progressing at a good pace but the more she reads and works on her weekly assignments the quicker her progress will be.  You can do it Adelynn!",

She can react to an oral message and respond appropriately. When reading, Adelynn retells story events in sequential order. She also makes links between the texts she reads and her life. I encourage her to look at the whole word to ensure she reads the ending properly. Adelynn is able to take her ideas and develop them into stories written in an organized and logical manner. As a next step, I would like her to search the dictionary for English words in her text.",

They are:the consistent use of capital letters for proper nouns, the first of a sentence and the pronoun I, also variation of sentence length and use of effective transition words. She is doing well in these areas. However, she will need to work on adding more details to her assignments and expanding her thoughts.  We have worked on numerous strategies and Maddy needs to apply them to each writing piece we do. In reading the two outcomes worked on are: using all sources of information to solve unknown words and identifying most key story elements and including some relevant details. She is progressing well but it is very important to complete the weekly assignments.  Doing so will help her grow as a reader.  You can do it Maddy!",

We will continue to work on her nervousness to sound out words on her own. She tends to want to wait for me to help her but she will need to take chances and know it is okay if things are not spelled correctly all the time. There have been two foundational learnings we have been working on this term in writing. They are: the consistent use of capital letters for proper nouns, the first of a sentence and the pronoun I, also variation of sentence length and use of effective transition words.  In her writing she is adding more details and becoming more aware of the conventions needed. In reading the two outcomes worked on are: using all sources of information to solve unknown words and identifying most key story elements and including some relevant details. In reading she is not at grade level but I am hoping with extra support that this will help her advance.",

Raina is working on becoming more confident in participating in class discussions. She can react to an oral message and respond appropriately. When reading, Raina retells story events in sequential order. She also makes links between the texts she reads and her life. I encourage her to look at the whole word to ensure she reads the ending properly. Raina is able to take her ideas and develop them into stories written in an organized and logical manner. As a next step, I would like her to work on her writing endurance.",

This term, we worked on one foundational outcome and one other math outcome. Raina was able to model concretely, pictorially and symbolically whole numbers to 10,000. She did have a lot of difficulty reading and recording numbers to 10,000, as well as saying the numbers orally. Raina is also starting to compare and order numbers to 10,000, but needs to take her time reading the questions properly. As a next step, I encourage her to work on saying her numbers orally, especially numbers containing 60s, 70s, 80s, and 90s as she tends to mix them up.",

There have been two foundational learnings we have been working on this term in writing. They are: the consistent use of capital letters for proper nouns, the first of a sentence and the pronoun I, also variation of sentence length and use of effective transition words.   I am pleased that he is using the lessons taught in his work.  In reading the two outcomes worked on are: using all sources of information to solve unknown words and identifying most key story elements and including some relevant details. Bennett is progressing very well and I have no concerns at this time. Continuing to read and complete the weekly assignments will help progress more.  Keep up the good work Bennett!",

Bennett is becoming more confident in participating in class discussions. He can react to an oral message and respond appropriately. When reading, Bennett retells story events in sequential order. He also makes links between the texts he reads and his life. I encourage him to try adding expression when reading. Bennett is able to take his ideas and develop them into stories written in an organized and logical manner. As a next step, I would like him to include capitals and punctuation in his written texts.",

This term, we worked on one foundational outcome and one other math outcome. Bennett was able to model concretely, pictorially and symbolically whole numbers to 10,000. He was capable of reading and recording numbers to 10,000, as well as recognizing the value represented by each digit in a number. Bennett had a good understanding of comparing and ordering numbers to 10,000 as well. He also has a good grasp on placing numbers on a number line.

She is able to hold her own, right now, but as the work gets harder I am worried that she will not be able to keep up.  What she does complete, she does it well but not every assignment is completed or passed in. There have been two foundational learnings we have been working on this term in writing. They are: the consistent use of capital letters for proper nouns, the first of a sentence and the pronoun I, also variation of sentence length and use of effective transition words. I will continue to help her with the proper use of capital letters. In reading the two outcomes worked on are: using all sources of information to solve unknown words and identifying most key story elements and including some relevant details. She is progressing but she will need to keep reading and completing the weekly assignment to ensure she doesn\u2019t fall behind.  I know you can do it Addison!",

I encourage her to look at the whole word to ensure she reads the ending properly.

This term, we worked on one foundational outcome and one other math outcome. Addison was able to model concretely, pictorially and symbolically whole numbers to 10,000. She was capable of reading and recording numbers to 10,000, as well as recognizing the value represented by each digit in a number. Addison had a good understanding of comparing and ordering numbers to 10,000 as well. She also has a good grasp on placing numbers on a number line. As a next step, I would encourage Addison to practice representing numbers in various ways using base ten blocks.",

There have been two foundational learnings we have been working on this term in writing. They are: the consistent use of capital letters for proper nouns, the first of a sentence and the pronoun I, also variation of sentence length and use of effective transition words. She works hard and is applying the concepts taught in mini-lessons to her assignments.  She is adding details to her work and understands the use of conventions. In reading the two outcomes worked on are: using all sources of information to solve unknown words and identifying most key story elements and including some relevant details.  She is doing extremely well and at this point I have no concerns in this area.  Keep up the good work Anna Kate!",

She takes the lessons being taught and applies them to her work. There have been two foundational learnings we have been working on this term in writing: the consistent use of capital letters for proper nouns, the first of a sentence and the pronoun I, also variation of sentence length and use of effective transition words. Kinsey is doing well with both.  In reading the two outcomes worked on are: using all sources of information to solve unknown words and identifying most key story elements and including some relevant details. She is doing extremely well and at this point I have no concerns in this area.  Keep up the good work Kinsey!",

She can react to an oral message and respond appropriately. When reading, Kinsey retells story events in sequential order. She also makes links between the texts she reads and her life. I encourage her to keep in mind the silent letters at the end of words. Kinsey is able to take her ideas and develop them into stories written in an organized and logical manner. As a next step, I would like her to work on underlining words she\u2019s unsure how to spell, as well as taking the time to review and correct her written work.",

This term, we worked on one foundational outcome and one other math outcome. Kinsey was able to model concretely, pictorially and symbolically whole numbers to 10,000. She was capable of reading and recording numbers to 10,000, as well as recognizing the value represented by each digit in a number. Kinsey had a good understanding of comparing and ordering numbers to 10,000 as well. She also has a good grasp on placing numbers on a number line.

There have been two foundational learnings we have been working on this term in writing. They are: the consistent use of capital letters for proper nouns, the first of a sentence and the pronoun I, also variation of sentence length and use of effective transition words. His use of the spelling strategies is helping his writing improve.  If he gets into the habit of rereading his work, I know he will see the mistakes before he brings it to me.  We are working on neater, smaller printing and adding more details to his pieces of writing.  In reading the two outcomes worked on are: using all sources of information to solve unknown words and identifying most key story elements and including some relevant details.  In reading he is progressing at a good rate and the more he reads the quicker it will come.  Working on the weekly assignments will help him with reading and comprehension.  Keep up the good work!",

He can react to an oral message and respond appropriately. When reading, Riley retells story events in sequential order. He also makes links between the texts he reads and his life. I encourage him to look at the whole word to ensure he reads the ending properly. Riley is able to take his ideas and develop them into stories written in an organized and logical manner. As a next step, I would like him to search the dictionary for English words in his text.",

This term, we worked on one foundational outcome and one other math outcome. Riley was able to model concretely, pictorially and symbolically whole numbers to 10,000. He was capable of reading and recording numbers to 10,000, as well as recognizing the value represented by each digit in a number. Riley had a good understanding of comparing and ordering numbers to 10,000 as well. He also has a good grasp on placing numbers on a number line.

They are:the consistent use of capital letters for proper nouns, the first of a sentence and the pronoun I, also variation of sentence length and use of effective transition words. I am pleased with how she is applying all the lessons being taught and doing so she has shown growth with each assignment. In reading the two outcomes worked on are: using all sources of information to solve unknown words and identifying most key story elements and including some relevant details. She is doing extremely well and at this point I have no concerns in this area. I appreciate how she is willing to help others when I ask.  Keep up the good work Eden!",

She can react to an oral message and respond appropriately. When reading, Eden retells story events in sequential order. She also makes links between the texts she reads and her life. I encourage her to keep in mind the 3Qs in order to make self-corrections. Eden is able to take her ideas and develop them into stories written in an organized and logical manner. As a next step, I would like her to work on underlining words she\u2019s unsure how to spell.",

She was capable of reading and recording numbers to 10,000, as well as recognizing the value represented by each digit in a number. Eden had a good understanding of comparing and ordering numbers to 10,000 as well. She also has a good grasp on placing numbers on a number line.

He is adding more detail to make each assignment better. There have been two foundational learnings we have been working on this term in writing. They are: the consistent use of capital letters for proper nouns, the first of a sentence and the pronoun I, also variation of sentence length and use of effective transition words.  He still needs to work on capitalization and punctuation.  Kael also needs to work on what he learns in spelling and apply it to his writing.  In reading the two outcomes worked on are: using all sources of information to solve unknown words and identifying most key story elements and including some relevant details. He is progressing at a good pace but the more practice he does the quicker he will advance.  Keep up the good work Kael!",

They are:the consistent use of capital letters for proper nouns, the first of a sentence and the pronoun I, also variation of sentence length and use of effective transition words. Aryton has had some growth but there is room for improvement.  We will continue to work on adding details to his work and using capitals and periods correctly.  I would also like to see him work on smaller printing and being neater.  In reading the two outcomes worked on are: using all sources of information to solve unknown words and identifying most key story elements and including some relevant details. He is progressing at a good pace.  However, the more he reads and completes the assignments the quicker success will happen.  You can do it Aryton!",

She is adding details and using her conventions properly.There have been two foundational learnings we have been working on this term.  In writing the consistent use of capital letters for proper nouns, the first of a sentence and the pronoun I, also variation of sentence length and use of effective transition words. Ella Grace is consistently using both in her writing.  In reading the two outcomes worked on are: using all sources of information to solve unknown words and identifying most key story elements and including some relevant details. She is doing extremely well and at this point I have no concerns in this area.  Keep up the good work Ella Grace!",

She can react to an oral message and respond appropriately. When reading, Ella-Grace retells story events in sequential order. She also makes links between the texts she reads and her life. I encourage her to look at the whole word to ensure she reads the ending properly. Ella-Grace is able to take her ideas and develop them into stories written in an organized and logical manner. As a next step, I would like her to review her work more frequently to check for words that need an \u201Cs\u201D or \u201Cx\u201D for plural.",

She was capable of reading and recording numbers to 10,000, as well as recognizing the value represented by each digit in a number. Ella-Grace had a good understanding of comparing and ordering numbers to 10,000 as well. She also has a good grasp on placing numbers on a number line.

There have been two foundational learnings we have been working on this term in writing. They are: the consistent use of capital letters for proper nouns, the first of a sentence and the pronoun I, also variation of sentence length and use of effective transition words. Henry is not consistently using the lessons being taught in his assignments. He gets hung up with getting every word spelled correctly and that slows him down. We will work on applying the lessons from spelling to his work. He needs to see them not as two separate things. We will also continue to work on adding details to his writing. In reading the two outcomes worked on are: using all sources of information to solve unknown words and identifying most key story elements and including some relevant details. He is progressing at a good pace.  The more he reads and completes his weekly activity the more he will progress.  Keep up the good work!",

He can always be found speaking French with his peers. When reading, Henry retells story events in sequential order. He also makes links between the texts he reads and his life. I encourage him to look at the whole word to ensure he reads the ending properly. Henry is able to take his ideas and develop them into stories written in an organized and logical manner. As a next step, I would like him to take the time to review his work for capital letters.",

This term, we worked on one foundational outcome and one other math outcome. Henry was able to model concretely, pictorially and symbolically whole numbers to 10,000. He was capable of reading and recording numbers to 10,000, as well as recognizing the value represented by each digit in a number. Henry had a good understanding of comparing and ordering numbers to 10,000 as well. He also has a good grasp on placing numbers on a number line. As a next step, I would encourage Henry to practice representing numbers in various ways using base ten blocks, as well as writing numbers as words.",

They are: the consistent use of capital letters for proper nouns, the first of a sentence and the pronoun I, also variation of sentence length and use of effective transition words.  She is applying the lessons taught in her work and she is now adding more details and putting punctuation in properly.

She was capable of reading and recording numbers to 10,000, as well as recognizing the value represented by each digit in a number. Sunny had a good understanding of comparing and ordering numbers to 10,000 as well. She also has a good grasp on placing numbers on a number line.

This term, we worked on one foundational outcome and one other math outcome. Louisa was able to model concretely, pictorially and symbolically whole numbers to 10,000. She was capable of reading and recording numbers to 10,000, as well as recognizing the value represented by each digit in a number. Louisa had a good understanding of comparing and ordering numbers to 10,000 as well. She also has a good grasp on placing numbers on a number line. As a next step, I would encourage Louisa to practice fractions and decimal numbers in preparation of our next unit.",

Zakk is developing the ability to find value in listening while others are speaking.  In Writing, we have been working on linking ideas and phrases with connecting words, and consistently using capital letters when appropriate. Zakk can continue to work on using capital letters when initially drafting and writing for longer stretches of time to improve his stamina.  In Reading, we have been working on using all sources of information to solve unknown words.  Zakk has a wonderful ability to decode and spell multisyllabic words.  He can begin to work on analyzing the roots of words to make meaning of new vocabulary.  At home, Zakk can continue to share stories with family members and parents can help by eliciting key details.  He can also continue to read at least 20 minutes nightly and talk about what he has read.",

In whole group and small group settings, our class has been working on when to speak and when to listen. Amia continues to work on showing an awareness of when to speak and when to listen in whole group discussions.  She can continue to contribute her thoughts to the group. In Writing, we have been working on linking ideas and phrases with connecting words, consistently using capital letters when appropriate.  Amia can continue to work on making sure to use capital letters consistently when writing in all subject areas.  In Reading, we have been working on identifying key story elements of narrative text and using all sources of information to solve unknown words.  Amia can continue to work on using context clues, root words and prior knowledge to make meaning of new words.  She can continue to share stories with family members and parents can help by eliciting key details.",

Easton has the ability to listen and to know when he should join in to group discussions. In Writing, we have been working on linking ideas and phrases with connecting words, and consistently using capital letters when appropriate. Easton can continue to work on using capital letters when initially drafting and not only when editing a published piece.  He is also developing the ability to write on the line with neat handwriting. In Reading, we have been working on using all sources of information to solve unknown words.  Easton can continue to work on using more than one strategy to make meaning of unknown words.  At home, Easton can continue to share stories with family members and parents can help by eliciting key details.  He can also continue to read at least 20 minutes nightly and talk about what he has read.",

Overall our class has been working on when to speak and when to listen.  James is developing the ability to listen and watch others to know when he should join in as well as answering appropriately when ask a question. Due to his behavioral choices when writing, James has not contributed enough writing to receive a final grade this term. In Reading, we have been working on using all sources of information to solve unknown words. James is developing the ability to use more than one strategy to make meaning of unknown words.  At home, James can continue to share stories with family members and parents can help by eliciting key details.  He can also continue to read at least 20 minutes nightly and talk about what he has ready with a family member.",

Kamea benefits from repeated directions and then feels more confident to practice concepts. She can continue to work on asking for help and regrouping when solving addition problems.  Kamea can also benefit from practicing her multiplication facts at least five minutes nightly.  This can be done with games located on our class website or with her flashcards.",

Ty has the ability to listen and to know when he should join in to group discussions.  In Writing, we have been working on linking ideas and phrases with connecting words, and consistently using capital letters when appropriate.  Ty can continue to work on using capital letters when initially drafting.  In Reading, we have been using many sources of information to solve unknown words.  Ty is developing the ability to use more than one strategy to make meaning of unknown words.  At home, Ty can continue to share stories with family members and parents can help by eliciting key details.  He can also continue to read at least 20 minutes nightly and talk about what he has read with a family member.",

In whole group and small group settings, our class has been working on when to speak and when to listen. Ty continues to work on showing an awareness of when to speak and when to listen in whole group discussions.  He is usually willing to contribute his thoughts to the group.  In Writing, we have been working on linking ideas and phrases with connecting words, consistently using capital letters when appropriate.  Ty can continue to work on making sure to use capital letters consistently when writing in all subject areas.  In Reading, we have been working on identifying key story elements of narrative text and using all sources of information to solve unknown words.  Ty can continue to work on using context clues, root words and prior knowledge to make meaning of new words. He can continue to share stories with family members and parents can help by eliciting key details.",

During this first reporting period we have been working on representing and comparing numbers to 10 000 and multi-digit addition.  Manny is especially accurate when comparing the proper place value of digits up to one million.  He can continue to build on his mental math strategies when estimating sums and differences. Manny can benefit from practicing his multiplication facts up to 12's at least five minutes nightly.  This can be done with games located on our class website or with his flashcards.",

She continues to work on staying on topic when developing ideas.  In Reading, Courtney has been working on using multiple strategies to solve simple words and self-correcting when her reading does not make sense.  Courtney continues to work on monitoring when self-correcting is needed and to use picture clues to help revise meaning. Courtney can continue to share stories with people at home and caregivers can help by eliciting key details.  She can also continue to read at least 20 minutes nightly and talk about what she has read.",

Jordan can benefit from practicing his multiplication facts up to 12's at least five minutes nightly.  This can be done with games located on our class website or with his flashcards.",

Jed is developing the ability to listen to his classmates in group discussions. In Writing, we have been working on linking ideas and phrases with connecting words, and consistently using capital letters when appropriate. Jed can continue to work on using capital letters when initially drafting and not only when editing a published piece.  In Reading, we have been working on using all sources of information to solve unknown words.  Jed can continue to work on using more than one strategy to make meaning of unknown words.  At home, Jed can continue to share stories with family members.  He can also continue to read at least 20 minutes nightly and talk about what he has read with a family member.",
