Our Foundational Learnings in math this term focused on demonstrating an understanding of factors and multiples. Kael showed some success with  independently identifying multiples and factors of a given number, and understands the difference between a prime and composite number. He did show some difficulties with factoring large numbers. This term we also focused on demonstrating an understanding of multiplication and division of decimals. Kael attempted to independently estimate and solve multiplication and division problems, as well as place the decimal in the product\/quotient using estimation and number sense. Finally this term we are working on relating improper fractions to mixed numbers. Kael is demonstrating a good understanding of this concept so far. The next steps are to continue on with mixed numbers and improper fractions and work on measuring and classifying angles.Keep up the great work in math!",

He has a hard work ethic and is working hard to slow down in his work and produce neater work. Kael continues to ask for support when something is unclear to him. Kael continues to add to class discussion, as well as listen attentively to those around him when they are speaking. Kael is approaching grade level with good comprehension, and accuracy. He is working hard to add more expression to his reading especially when reading dialogue and slow down in his reading. In writing we have been working on fictional narratives and Kael has a good understanding of this genre and can independently generate ideas. We also have been working on procedural writing and Kael is able to independently explain how to do something he is knowledgeable about. Keep up the hard work, Kael!",

Our Foundational Learnings for speaking and listening this term focused on engaging in and responding to a variety of oral presentations. Annika was independently able to participate in oral presentations. She presented her ideas clearly and confidently and remained on topic, as well as spoke in a clear tone with good pacing. She was engaged and attentive when others were presenting and gave feedback to her peers. Our Foundational Learning for reading focused on interpreting relationships among several ideas to draw conclusions or make comparisons and support responses with relevant details. Annika showed some success with independently being able to explain how a character\u2019s actions, the setting, and a series of connecting events led to the main ideas and outcomes in a text. She attempted to use details from the text to support her responses. The next steps are to move to persuasive writing.",

Our Foundational Learnings in math this term focused on demonstrating an understanding of factors and multiples. Annika can independently identify multiples and factors of a given number, and understands the difference between a prime and composite number. This term we also focused on demonstrating an understanding of multiplication and division of decimals. Annika can independently estimate and solve multiplication and division problems, as well as place the decimal in the product\/quotient using estimation and number sense. Finally this term we are working on relating improper fractions to mixed numbers. Annika has a good understanding of this concept so far. The next steps are to continue on with mixed numbers and improper fractions and  work on measuring and classifying angles. Keep up the great work in math!",

She has a hard work ethic and will ask for help when she does not understand a certain concept. Annika is continuing to work on paying attention when instructions are being given, but can self regulate and get back on task quickly. She continues to add to class discussion, as well as listens attentively to those around her when they are speaking. Annika is approaching  grade level in reading with good fluency, comprehension, and accuracy for this time of year. She will continue to add details to her retelling of a text. In writing we have been working on fictional narratives and Annika has a good understanding of this genre and is able to independently generate ideas for her writing and will continue working on expanding her ideas. We also have been working on procedural writing and Annika is able to independently with good ordered details. Keep up the hard work!",

Our Foundational Learnings for speaking and listening this term focused on engaging in and responding to a variety of oral presentations. Morgan was independently able to participate in oral presentations. He presented his ideas clearly and confidently and remained on topic, as well as spoke in a clear tone with good pacing. He was engaged and attentive when others were presenting. Our Foundational Learning for reading focused on interpreting relationships among several ideas to draw conclusions or make comparisons and support responses with relevant details. Morgan experienced some success with independently being able to explain how a character\u2019s actions, the setting, and a series of connecting events led to the main ideas and outcomes in a text. He made some attempts to use details from the text to support his responses but needs to expand these ideas.The next steps are to move to persuasive writing.",

Our Foundational Learnings in math this term focused on demonstrating an understanding of factors and multiples. Morgan can independently identify multiples and factors of a given number, and understands the difference between a prime and composite number. This term we also focused on demonstrating an understanding of multiplication and division of decimals. Morgan can independently estimate and solve multiplication and division problems, as well as place the decimal in the product\/quotient using estimation and number sense. He will continue to work on strengthening his abilities with word problems.  Finally this term we are working on relating improper fractions to mixed numbers. Morgan is demonstrating a good understanding of this concept so far. The next steps are to continue on with mixed numbers and improper fractions and work on measuring and classifying angles. Morgan has shown growth with his math facts",

He is working hard to add details to his work and go back over and double check work before submitting it. Morgan continues to add to class discussion, as well as listens more attentively to those around him when they are speaking. Morgan is reading at grade level with good fluency, comprehension, and accuracy for this time of year. In writing we have been working on fictional narratives and Morgan has a good understanding of this genre and can independently generate ideas for his stories. We also have been working on procedural writing and Morgan is able to independently explain how to do something he is knowledgeable about but does have to be reminded  to expand upon his steps and focus on the structure of his writing. Keep up the hard work, Morgan!",

She is continuing to word hard and stay focused with seeing a task through to completion. Desteny continues to add to class discussion and is showing improvements on listening when others are speaking. Desteny is reading below grade level for this time of year. She will continue to keep strengthening her word attack and fluency in her reading. In writing we have been working on fictional narratives and Desteny has a good understanding of this genre. She is able to generate topics for her stories, and will continue to strengthen her ability to see a piece to the finish line. We also have been working on procedural writing and Desteny is able to independently explain how to do something she is knowledgeable about. Keep up the hard work, Desteny!",

Daniel was independently able to participate in oral presentations. He presented his ideas clearly and confidently and remained on topic, as well as spoke in a clear tone with good pacing.

Our Foundational Learnings in math this term focused on demonstrating an understanding of factors and multiples. Daniel showed some success with independently identifying multiples and factors of a given number, and understands the difference between a prime and composite number. He did show some difficulties with factoring large numbers. This term we also focused on demonstrating an understanding of multiplication and division of decimals. Daniel missed a significant amount of instructional time during remote learning in math and did not submit the assigned work. As a result, I have not been able to accurately assess his progress for this reporting period on this concept. The next steps for Daniel are to continue to work on multiplying and dividing decimals and work on demonstrating and understanding of mixed numbers and improper fractions. It would be very helpful to practice his math facts nightly.",

Daniel is still experiencing difficulty getting started in his work without constant prompting. At this time in the year he is not showing his true potential of what I know he is capable of and can be very reluctant to do his work. I would really like to see Daniel contribute to class discussion more often, as well as listen more attentively to those around him when they are speaking. Daniel is approaching grade level with good fluency and accuracy for this time of year. In writing we have been working on fictional narratives and Daniel experienced difficulties with this genre and struggled to generate ideas independently for his stories. We also have been working on procedural writing and Daniel struggled to  independently explain how to do something he is knowledgeable about but is not using any proper punctuation in his writing.",

He did show some difficulties with factoring large numbers. This term we also focused on demonstrating an understanding of multiplication and division of decimals. TJ missed a significant amount of instructional time during remote learning in math and  I have not been able to accurately assess his progress for this reporting period in Math. The next steps for TJ are to continue to work on multiplying and dividing decimals and work on demonstrating and understanding of mixed numbers and improper fractions. It would be very beneficial for TJ to continue to work on his basic multiplication facts nightly.",

TJ is contributing to class discussion but need to focus on listening to his peers when they speak. TJ is reading at  grade level with good fluency and accuracy for this time of year. He will continue to expand on his retelling of ideas from a text.

Colin can independently identify multiples and factors of a given number, and understands the difference between a prime and composite number. This term we also focused on demonstrating an understanding of multiplication and division of decimals. Colin can independently estimate and solve multiplication and division problems, as well as place the decimal in the product\/quotient using estimation and number sense. Finally this term we are working on relating improper fractions to mixed numbers. Colin is demonstrating a clear and concise understanding of this concept so far. The next steps are to continue on with mixed numbers and improper fractions and work on measuring and classifying angles. Colin is a very hard worker in math and shows great talents with his abilities. Keep up the great work!",

He has a hard work ethic and takes great pride in his work. Colin continues to add to class discussion, as well as listens more attentively to those around him when they are speaking. Colin is reading at grade level with good fluency, comprehension, and accuracy for this time of year. In writing we have been working on fictional narratives and Colin has a good understanding of this genre and can independently generate ideas and see them through to a completed story. We also have been working on procedural writing and Colin is able to independently, with good detail explain how to do something he is knowledgeable about. Keep up the hard work, Colin!",

Our Foundational Learnings in math this term focused on demonstrating an understanding of factors and multiples.

He did show some difficulties with factoring large numbers. This term we also focused on demonstrating an understanding of multiplication and division of decimals. London attempted to independently estimate and solve multiplication and division problems, as well as place the decimal in the product\/quotient using estimation and number sense. Finally this term we are working on relating improper fractions to mixed numbers. London is demonstrating some understanding of this concept so far.

He is working hard to add details to his work and go back over and double check work before submitting it. London continues to add to class discussion, and listens to those around him. London does a great job of asking for help and making sure he fully understands what is expected of him before proceeding with his work!  London is reading below grade level for this time of year with good comprehension. We will continue to work on his accuracy and fluency. In writing we have been working on fictional narratives and London has a good understanding of this genre and can independently generate ideas for his stories. We also have been working on procedural writing and London is able to independently explain how to do something he is knowledgeable about but does have to be reminded  to expand upon his steps and focus on the structure of his writing.",

Keira was independently able to participate in oral presentations. She presented her ideas clearly and confidently and remained on topic, as well as spoke in a clear tone with good pacing. She was engaged and attentive when others were presenting and gave feedback and posed questions\/comments to her peers. Our Foundational Learning for reading focused on interpreting relationships among several ideas to draw conclusions or make comparisons and support responses with relevant details. Keira was able to independently explain how a character\u2019s actions, the setting, and a series of connecting events led to the main ideas and outcomes in a text. She was able to also use details from the text to support her responses. The next steps are to move to persuasive writing.",

Our Foundational Learnings for speaking and listening this term focused on engaging in and responding to a variety of oral presentations. Willow was independently able to participate in oral presentations. She presented her ideas clearly and confidently and remained on topic, as well as spoke in a clear tone with good pacing. She was engaged and attentive when others were presenting and gave feedback and posed questions\/comments to her peers. Our Foundational Learning for reading focused on interpreting relationships among several ideas to draw conclusions or make comparisons and support responses with relevant details. Willow was able to independently explain how a character\u2019s actions, the setting, and a series of connecting events led to the main ideas and outcomes in a text. She was able to also use details from the text to support her responses. The next steps are to move to persuasive writing.",

Our Foundational Learnings in math this term focused on demonstrating an understanding of factors and multiples. Willow can independently identify multiples and factors of a given number, and understands the difference between a prime and composite number. This term we also focused on demonstrating an understanding of multiplication and division of decimals. Willow can independently estimate and solve multiplication and division problems, as well as place the decimal in the product\/quotient using estimation and number sense. She will continue to work on her division strategies and gain more confidence in this concept. Finally this term we are working on relating improper fractions to mixed numbers. Willow is demonstrating a good understanding of this concept so far. The next steps are to continue on with mixed numbers and improper fractions and work on measuring and classifying angles. Keep up the great work!",

Willow is reading at grade level with good fluency, comprehension, and accuracy for this time of year. In writing we have been working on fictional narratives and Willow has a good understanding of this genre and can independently generate ideas and see them through to a completed story.  We also have been working on procedural writing and Willow is able to independently, with good detail explain how to do something she is knowledgeable about. Keep up the hard work, Willow!",

Our Foundational Learning for reading focused on interpreting relationships among several ideas to draw conclusions or make comparisons and support responses with relevant details. Jason experienced some difficulties with independently being able to explain how a character\u2019s actions, the setting, and a series of connecting events led to the main ideas and outcomes in a text.

Our Foundational Learnings in math this term focused on demonstrating an understanding of factors and multiples. Jason showed some success with  independently identifying multiples and factors of a given number, and understands the difference between a prime and composite number. He did show some difficulties with factoring large numbers. This term we also focused on demonstrating an understanding of multiplication and division of decimals. Jason attempted to independently estimate and solve multiplication and division problems, as well as place the decimal in the product\/quotient using estimation and number sense. Finally this term we are working on relating improper fractions to mixed numbers. Jason is demonstrating some understanding of this concept so far. The next steps are to continue on with mixed numbers and improper fractions and work on measuring and classifying angles. Keep up the hard work in math!",

Jason is approaching grade level in his reading with comprehension and accuracy. He is going to continue to work on using punctuation properly in his reading and slowing down in his pace. In writing we have been working on fictional narratives and Jason has a good understanding of this genre. We also have been working on procedural writing and Jason is able to independently explain how to do something he is knowledgeable about but does have to be reminded  to expand upon his steps and focus on the structure of his writing.

She has a good work ethic and takes great pride in her work. Isabella will seek support if she is not understanding a concept which is great to see. Isabella continues to add to class discussion, as well as listen attentively to those around her when they are speaking. Isabella is reading at grade level with good fluency, comprehension, and accuracy for this time of year. In writing we have been working on fictional narratives and Isabella has a good understanding of this genre and is able to independently generate ideas for her writing. We also have been working on procedural writing and Isabella is able to independently and will continue to work on expanding the details in her ordered steps. Keep up the hard work, Isabella!",

In writing, we have deepened our knowledge on realistic stories and we began to learn about the components of the critical genre. Olivia shows good knowledge and application of writing conventions and her writing has shown great improvement in spelling over the past several weeks.

In the last term, we have worked on demonstrating an understanding of fraction and multiplication and division of decimals. We are currently expanding our knowledge on angles. Olivia can consistently express improper fractions as mixed numbers and vice-versa. She can also place a given set of fractions on a number line. She can solve a given problem that involves multiplication and division of decimals. She can also place the decimal point in a product and a quotient using front-end estimation. Her next step should be to continue to practice her multiplication facts. My suggestion would be to practice those at home using different strategies, like flash cards and games.

She follows directions well and she is self-sufficient within the classroom. She is a responsible and considerate classmate and she is respectful to other students and teachers. However, Olivia misses important information each time she is late. Your support is needed in this area. She is a kind, courteous and well-behaved student. She is progressing nicely in all subject areas in grade six so far and I look forward to continuing to work with her, as we look ahead to the next few months of this school year. One focus area for Olivia for the next term is to use her French language as much as possible every day in her reading, writing and speaking. I recommend choosing to listen to music or programs in French at home in order to have more French-speaking experiences outside of school. Keep up the wonderful things you are doing Olivia! You are a sixth grader who truly shines!",

He is a helpful, energetic and imaginative student and he shows a positive attitude towards peers and school activities. He is progressing nicely in all subject areas in grade six so far and I look forward to continuing to work with him, as we look ahead to the next few months of this school year. One focus area for Carter for the next term is to use his French language as much as possible every day in his reading, writing and speaking. I recommend choosing to listen to music or programs in French at home in order to have more French-speaking experiences outside of school. Keep up the wonderful things you are doing Carter!

She is a cheerful, imaginative and energetic student and the enthusiasm she shows for school, friends and life in general energizes our whole room. Lexi puts effort into her assignments and tries her best throughout the day. She is progressing nicely in all subject areas in grade six so far and I look forward to continuing to work with her, as we look ahead to the next few months of this school year. One focus area for Lexi for the next term is to use his French language as much as possible every day in her reading, writing and speaking. I recommend choosing to listen to music or programs in French at home in order to have more French-speaking experiences outside of school. Keep up the wonderful things you are doing Lexi! You are a sixth grader who truly shines!",

She is reading below grade level for this time of the year, but I am seeing constant progress since the beginning of the year. In writing, we have deepened our knowledge on realistic stories and we began to learn about the components of the critical genre. It is difficult to accurately report on Kate's progress for term 2.

Kloe is meeting expectations within all criteria given. She has shown great improvements within her writing in relation to conventions and sentence structure. We will continue to work on these areas becoming even more developed as we move into third and final reporting period.

She listens well and shares ideas frequently. In reading, she retells events from a story in a sequential manner and she reads closely to determine what the text says explicitly with support and frequent conferences. She is reading below grade level for this time of the year, but I am seeing constant progress since the beginning of the year. In writing, we have deepened our knowledge on realistic stories and we began to learn about the components of the critical genre. Kloe shows good knowledge and application of writing conventions and her writing has shown great improvement in spelling over the past several weeks. She conveys her thoughts and ideas clearly, as she writes opinion pieces with well thought-out, supportive reasoning. Bravo pour ton super travail!",

One focus area for Kloe for the next term is to use her French language as much as possible every day in her reading, writing and speaking.

We will continue to work on these areas becoming even more developed as we move into third and final reporting period.

She is an important member of small group discussions and I am confident that with support and practice this should transfer to a whole-group setting. In reading, she is able to identify the setting, characters, problem and solution. She retells events from a story in a sequential manner and she reads closely to determine what the text says. She is reading slightly below grade level for this time of the year but I am seeing constant progress since the beginning of the year. In writing, we have deepened our knowledge on realistic story and we began to learn about the components of the critical genre. Emily continues to make progress in writing. However, there is still a significant number of spelling or grammatical errors in her writing, sometimes making understanding her text difficult. I strongly encourage Emily to seek help, by asking questions and having peer and teacher conferences often. Bravo Emily!",

She demonstrates a strong knowledge of the material covered in grade six so far and I look forward to continuing to work with her, as we look ahead to the next few months of this school year. One focus area for Emily for the next term is to continue to use her French language as much as possible every day in his reading, writing and speaking.  I recommend choosing to listen to music or programs in French at home in order to have more French-speaking experiences outside of school. Keep up the wonderful things you are doing Emily!

In writing, we have read several mentor texts on features and criteria on what makes a great persuasive piece. Lincoln selected, \" Having Another Amusement Park on PE\" for his topic. Lincoln is meeting expectations within all criteria given. He has shown great improvements within his writing in relation to conventions and sentence structure. We will continue to work on these areas becoming even more developed as we move into third and final reporting period. Lincoln continues to meet expectations within reading as he continues to read with fluency and has good comprehension.  We will continue to work on Lincoln's reading and speaking with expression to help give voice to his read material. Proud of you, Lincoln! Keep up your efforts!",

He listens well and shares ideas frequently. In reading, he uses strategies such as making connections, asking questions about the text, and inferencing to aid his comprehension. He also has very good fluency and intonation. He is reading at grade level for this time of the year and I have seen constant improvement and growth in the last few months. In writing, we have deepened our knowledge on realistic stories and we began to learn about the components of the critical genre. Lincoln continues to make good progress in writing. I am seeing better spelling, however, he sometimes struggle with expanding his ideas in a proper way without repeating the same ideas. I strongly encourage Lincoln to slow down and take his time to check his work with the intentions of producing the best work possible. Tu peux \u00EAtre tr\u00E8s fier de toi!",

In the last term, we have worked on demonstrating an understanding of fraction and multiplication and division of decimals. We are currently expanding our knowledge on angles. Lincoln can consistently express improper fractions as mixed numbers and vice-versa. He can also place a given set of fractions on a number line. He can easily solve a given problem that involves multiplication and division of decimals. He can also place the decimal point in a product and a quotient using front-end estimation. Congratulations on mastering your multiplication and division facts! My suggestion would be to continue practicing them at home using different strategies to keep mastery of mental math techniques. Continue ton super travail!",

He is an inquisitive learner who enjoys analyzing situations and making new discoveries in all parts of the school day. He is learning how to work in group settings and makes many contributions to the group. He is a pleasant, capable and creative student. He demonstrates a strong knowledge of the material covered in grade six so far and I look forward to continuing to work with him, as we look ahead to the next few months of this school year. One goal for next term is for Lincoln to use his French language as much as possible every day in his reading, writing and speaking. I recommend choosing to listen to music or programs in French at home in order to have more French-speaking experiences outside of school. Keep up the wonderful things you are doing Lincoln! You are a sixth grader who truly shines!",

In the last term, we have worked on demonstrating an understanding of fraction and multiplication and division of decimals. We are currently expanding our knowledge on angles. Riley can consistently express improper fractions as mixed numbers and vice-versa. He can also place a given set of fractions on a number line. He can solve a given problem that involves multiplication and division of decimals. He can also place the decimal point in a product and a quotient using front-end estimation. His next step should be to continue to practice his multiplication facts. My suggestion would be to practice those at home using different strategies, like flash cards and games.

He welcomes new tasks and seeks new opportunities for learning. However, Riley can sometimes be distracted. He needs encouragement to stay focused on the task at hand and to comply with classroom expectations. We will continue to focus on this goal and hopefully see changes before the end of the year. He demonstrates a strong knowledge on some of the material covered in grade six so far and I look forward to continuing to work with him, as we look ahead to the next few months of this school year. One goal for next term is for Riley to use his French language as much as possible every day in his reading, writing and speaking. I recommend choosing to listen to music or programs in French at home in order to have more French-speaking experiences outside of school. Keep up the wonderful things you are doing Riley!

She is generous, cooperative and hard-working in class. I am so impressed with the effort she puts forth and the perseverance she shows every day in her work. However, Vianna doesn't have time to be organized and ready for the day each time she is late. Your support is needed in this area. She is progressing nicely in all subject areas in grade six so far and I look forward to continuing to work with her, as we look ahead to the next few months of this school year. One goal for next term is for Vianna is to use her French language as much as possible every day in her reading, writing and speaking. I recommend choosing to listen to music or programs in French at home in order to have more French-speaking experiences outside of school. Keep up the wonderful things you are doing Vianna! You are a sixth grader who truly shines!",

She is an active participant in small and\/or large group discussions and she listens well and shares information frequently.

She is reading at grade level for this time of the year and I have seen constant improvement and growth in the last few months. In writing, we have deepened our knowledge on realistic stories and we began to learn about the components of the critical genre.

She is a co-operative student who works well with other classmates and she is a self-motivated worker who works independently and stays focused on the task at hand. She is attentive, courteous and hard-working in class. However, she is encouraged to ask questions and participate on a more regular basis in classroom lessons and discussions in order to ensure understanding. She demonstrates a good knowledge on some of the material covered in grade six so far and I look forward to continuing to work with her, has we look ahead to the next few months of this school year. One focus area for Ruby for the next term is to use her French language as much as possible every day in her reading, writing and speaking. Another goal for the end of the year would be to remember the importance of completing tasks in the time required without needing regular reminders. Keep up the wonderful things you are doing Ruby!

He is an important member of group discussions and he listens well and shares ideas frequently. In reading, he is able to identify the setting, characters, problem, and solution. He retells events from a story in a sequential manner and he reads closely to determine what the text says explicitly. He is reading slightly below grade level for this time of the year, but I am seeing improvement and growth in the last few months. In writing, we have deepened our knowledge on realistic stories and we began to learn about the components of the critical genre. Nixxon continues to make good progress in writing. I am seeing better spelling, however, he sometimes struggles with expanding his ideas in a proper way without repeating the same ideas. I strongly encourage Nixxon to seek help, by asking questions and having peer and teacher conferences often. Bravo pour ton super travail!",

However, he is struggling with some basic academic skills of the 6th grade. It is difficult to accurately report Sherzad's progress for term 2 as he has not attended since Christmas break. We will see what the next few months bring in order to get him ready for junior high. One focus area for Sherzad is  to continue to use his French language as much as possible every day in his reading, writing and speaking. Keep up the wonderful things you are doing Sherzad! We hope to see you back in school soon.",

He is an active listener and important member of group discussions. He listens well and shares ideas frequently. In reading, he retells events from a story in a sequential manner and he reads closely to determine what the text says explicitly with support and frequent conferences. He is reading below grade level for this time of the year, but I am seeing improvement and growth in the last few months. In writing, we have deepened our knowledge on realistic story and we began to learn about the components of the critical genre. It is difficult to accurately report on Braydon's progress for term 2. During remote learning in January and over the course of term 2, Braydon did not show enough evidence of learning for me to fairly assess progress. We hope to get back on track soon.

During remote learning in January and over the course of term 2, Braydon did not show enough evidence of learning for me to fairly assess progress. We hope to get back on track soon.

He follows classroom rules and he is a pleasant, respectful and well-behaved student However, he needs to take responsibilities for his learning and work habits, as he rarely hands in his homework. He demonstrates a good knowledge on some of the material covered in grade six so far and I look forward to continuing to work with him, as we look ahead to the next few months of this school year. One focus area for Braydon is to use time wisely to finish tasks in the time required and to be more responsible in completing tasks without needing regular reminders. I recommend choosing to listen to music or programs in French at home in order to have more French-speaking experiences outside of school. Keep up the wonderful things you are doing Braydon! You are a sixth grader who truly shines!",

She has shown great improvements within her writing in relation to conventions and sentence structure. We will continue to work on these areas becoming even more developed as we move into third and final reporting period. Alexza  continues to meet expectations within reading as she continues to read with fluency and has good comprehension.  Proud of you, Alexza! Keep up your daily efforts and love of learning.",

She is an active participant in small and\/or large group discussions, listens well and shares appropriate and relevant information frequently. In reading, she retells events from a story in a sequential manner an she reads closely to determine what the text says explicitly with support and frequent conferences. She is reading below grade level for this time of the year, but I am seeing constant progress since the beginning of the year. In writing, we have deepened our knowledge on realistic stories and we began to learn about the components of the critical genre. Alexza is a creative writer with a refreshing sense of voice, clarity, and style. She applies writing conventions easily and with high proficiency and she demonstrates an expansive vocabulary.

In the last term we have worked on demonstrating an understanding of fraction and multiplication and division of decimals. We are currently expanding our knowledge on angles. It is difficult to accurately report on Alexza's progress for term 2. During remote learning in January and over the course of term 2, Alexza did not show enough evidence of learning for me to fairly assess progress. We hope to get back on track soon.  We hope to get back on track soon. Her next step should be to continue to practice her multiplication facts. My suggestion would be to practice those at home using different strategies, like flash cards and games. Continue tes beaux efforts!",

She is cooperative, a good worker and an attentive listener. She shows great interest in our studies and takes pride in her work. She is progressing nicely in all subject areas in grade six so far and I look forward to continuing to work with her, as we look ahead to the next few months of this school year. One focus area for Alexza for the next term is to use her French language as much as possible every day in her reading, writing and speaking. Another goal for the end of the year would be to remember the importance of completing tasks in the time required without needing regular reminders. Keep up the wonderful things you are doing Alexza! You are a sixth grader who truly shines!",

The writing traits we have been working on this term is supporting ideas with relevant details and adding precise, interesting and technical words\/language to assignments.

Also, interpreting relationships among several ideas to draw conclusions or make comparisons. She continues to read above grade level. Keep up the great work Tatum!",

This term in French Language Arts we have worked on procedural writing and opinion writing. Tatum has demonstrated a good understanding of these topics. Tatum is usually able to use the infinitive tense to give directions in simple sentences during a procedural piece of writing. Tatum worked hard to translate a recipe from English to French and gave a wonderful presentation of said recipe. Tatum has also developed skills in opinion writing and has been able to share her opinion on various topics. Tatum usually works hard during writing class and sometimes shares her ideas with the group. Tatum is usually able to communicate with both teachers and peers in French. Tatum is a great self advocate and always asks for help when needed. I would encourage Tatum to focus on her work during independent work times so as to achieve the quality of work I know she is capable of!",

Tatum can consistently express improper fractions as mixed numbers and vice-versa. She can also place a given set of fractions on a number line without difficulty. She can solve a given problem that involves multiplication and division of decimals. She can also place the decimal point in a product and a quotient using front-end estimation. Her next step should be to continue to practice her multiplication facts. My suggestion would be to practice those at home using different strategies, like flash cards and games.

There are times when he needs reminders to be attentive during instructions and to stay on task during independent work time as he can be easily distracted.  This has caused him to struggle with new concepts at times.  Fortunately, Jaxon is very good to ask for assistance when he is unsure of an outcome and he is encouraged to use his time wisely to finish tasks in the time required. He needs to make sure he is reading 20 minutes each day in order to continue to progress with his fluency and comprehension.  He has many great ideas to share in his writing, while making sure he uses the proper organization and conventions within his pieces of writing.  Keep up the good work Jaxon.",

He always looks for ways to be helpful in the classroom and he shows a positive attitude with classmates in group projects and activities, and both takes and gives suggestions and directions effectively. Chase is having a difficult time in certain areas of math, but when given extra time and one to one attention, he is able to complete the material. He should continue to work on his multiplication facts and division facts just to help build up his confidence as it will help when working with new outcomes.  Reading for 30 minutes each day will continue to help him move forward in his reading fluency and comprehension.  Keep up the great work Chase.",

Throughout the term students worked on relating improper fractions to mixed numbers.

He is dependable and reliable, follows directions effectively, and follows through on his commitments to himself and others.  He shows a positive attitude with classmates in group projects and activities, and both takes and gives suggestions and directions effectively.  Aiden is focused during class and contributes ideas willingly as he performs independent work with more confidence and focus.  He needs to continue to make sure that he is reading at least 30 minutes a day at home and when completing his writing, he needs to ensure that he is using the correct organization and conventions within each piece of writing.  Way to go Aiden, keep up the great work.",

He is a very responsible student who gets along well with everyone in the group. He is helpful and considerate when it comes to the needs of others. Johnny is often prepared and ready to work whether independently or as a group, most of the time. He is a fluent reader and continues to work on adding great details to his writing.  He is also very keen to learn and understand new math concepts.  He is most certainly capable of being a leader within the group. Keep up the great work Johnny!",

Destiny loves to share her ideas and seems to enjoy doing so in small group work.  Destiny will participate in our classroom discussions but she is not a student who would initiate a whole class conversation as she is very quiet.  In Math, she is struggling to keep up with new concepts at times. She could benefit from practicing the multiplication table and should also continue to practice other basic math skills. Destiny should also remember to read for at least 30 minutes each day to continue to improve her fluency and comprehension. Keep up the hard work Destiny!!",
